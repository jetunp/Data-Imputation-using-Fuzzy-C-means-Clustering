# Data-Imputation-using-Fuzzy-C-means-Clustering
Data Analysis is a process of cleaning, transforming and modeling to gather useful information.In the real-time situations, data will have missing values, which on occurrence are supposed to be imputed. Imputation is the process of replacing the missing values in the given dataset with any calculated substitute values. With the presence of missing values, data analysis cannot be performed as we require the complete data set for it. Different methodologies for data imputation such as K-nearest neighbors, KNN Imputation, Hot Deck, Single Value Decomposition method and Local Least Square methods are utilized. We have used the Fuzzy C-means clustering method to initialize the dataset in order to impute the missing information, which divides the data with nearby values in the dataset under a single cluster. With the centroid values of the cluster and membership function of each value in the dataset we can finally impute the missing data values.
